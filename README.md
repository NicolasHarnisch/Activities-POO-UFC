# Object-Oriented Programming - UFC üéì

This repository contains the practical assignments and the final project developed for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at the Federal University of Cear√° (UFC).  
The focus is on applying **OOP principles** to design modular, reusable, and scalable software systems.

---

### üìñ About This Repository

The main goal of this repository is to document the practical application of **object-oriented concepts** such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
It includes solutions to various assignment lists and a final project that consolidates the knowledge acquired throughout the course.

---

### üöÄ Activities & Projects Developed

‚úÖ **Final Project: Employee Management System**  
* A complete console application developed using object-oriented design principles.  
* Features CRUD functionalities, data encapsulation, file persistence, and modular class structures.

‚úÖ **List 3: Inheritance and Polymorphism**  
* Exercises focusing on class hierarchies, method overriding, and the use of abstract classes and interfaces.

‚úÖ **List 2: Classes, Objects, and Encapsulation**  
* Solutions to problems that reinforce the use of classes, constructors, getters/setters, and encapsulated data handling.

‚úÖ **Practical Activities**  
* Additional exercises designed to strengthen the understanding of OOP concepts such as composition, associations, and modular programming.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

This repository contains multiple separate projects and assignment lists. To run a specific activity:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NicolasHarnisch/Activities-POO-UFC.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the desired folder:**
    Each activity is organized into its own folder (e.g., `Final-Project`, `List-2`, etc.).
    ```bash
    cd "Activities-POO-UFC"
    ```

3.  **Compile and run the program:**
    Depending on the language used, commands may vary:

    ```bash
    # Example for Java
    javac Main.java
    java Main
