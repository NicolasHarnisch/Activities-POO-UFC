> **Subject:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository serves as an academic portfolio, documenting my trajectory and technical evolution in software development with Java.

Here are gathered complete systems, practical exercises, and refactorings, organized to demonstrate the application of the main concepts of Object-Oriented Programming and Software Engineering.

## 📂 Repository Organization

The project was structured to clearly separate the **authorial (Student)** development from the **reference and answer key (Professor)** materials, facilitating comparative study and code maintenance.

## 🚀 Projects and Developed Systems
Below, I detail the main modules built, highlighting the complexity and concepts applied in each solution.

---

### 1. Modeling and Business Rules
| Project | Description and Applied Concepts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🏦 Banking System** | Fundamental implementation of **Encapsulation**. Strict control of attribute access (balance), with validations for withdrawals, deposits, and transfers. |
| **🎓 Course System** | Focus on **Class Relationships** (Association, Aggregation, and Composition). Complex management of links between Students, Classes, and Subjects. |
| **🛍️ Store System** | Application of **Inheritance and Polymorphism**. Creation of product hierarchies with distinct behaviors for tax and price calculations. |

### 2. Architecture, Robustness, and Quality
| Project | Description and Applied Concepts |
| :--- | :--- |
| **💳 Payment System** | Use of **Interfaces and Abstract Classes** to create flexible contracts, allowing multiple payment methods (Boleto, Pix, Card) without tight coupling. |
| **🚌 Transport System** | *Evaluative Practice.* Development of logic for routes and fleet management, requiring requirement interpretation and UML modeling. |
| **⚠️ Error Handling** | Implementation of **Custom Exceptions** and robust `try-catch` blocks. The system prevents critical failures (like negative stock) by throwing clear errors. |
| **✅ Automated Testing** | Introduction to software quality with **JUnit**, ensuring critical methods work as expected before final implementation. |
